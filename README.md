# Musical Structure App Project

Fifth Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

The goal was to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files.

I had to think about the structure of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within the app.
